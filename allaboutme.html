    </h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am Carlos. I am 14 years old at the time I'm writing this. I can speak both english and spanish because I'm smart. Just kidding. It's actually because lived in Mexico until 4th grade.</p>
    <p>I play Pokemon. If you know me in real life, then you probably already knew that. My favorite pokemon is Greninja. I'm also in the water polo team. My favorite food is spaghetti, but my favorite dessert is pie.</p>
    <p>Do you like pie?</p>
    <a href="yes.html">yes</a>
    <a href="no.html">no</a>
